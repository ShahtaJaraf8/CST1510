# =================================================================== FUNCTIONS
# 1. Write parse_line(raw_line) that cleans and parses one raw, messy line
#    into a dict. Handle inconsistent spacing and case - that is the whole
#    point of this week.
#
#    Typical and above: also write status_of(...), shaped for your lane
#    (e.g. OVER LIMIT / WARNING / OK, or FLAGGED / OK). Give both a
#    one-line docstring.

# your function(s) go here
def parse_line(raw_line):
  """Clean and parse a raw, messy survey line into a structured dictionary."""
  line = raw_line.strip().lower()
  survey_part, rest = line.split(",", 1)
  data = {"survey": survey_part.strip()}

  for piece in rest.split(","):
    key, value = piece.split("=")
    data[key.strip()] = float(value.strip())

  return data


def status_of(data):
  """Evaluate survey rating and return the status (FLAGGED or OK)."""
  rating = data["rating"]
  if rating < 3:
    return "FLAGGED"
  else:
    return "OK"
  

# ====================================================================== INPUT
# 2. Your raw, messy records - at least 5, deliberately varied in spacing
#    and case. Match the shape to your lane:
#
#    AI / Data Science : "  Survey_2026 , rating=4 , age=23  "
#    Cyber Security     : "SRC=10.0.0.5,ATTEMPTS=12,RESULT=FAILED"
#    IT                  : "  Srv-01 , used=87 , total=100  "
#
#    Excellent: save these lines to a file and load them with open() /
#    a for loop over the file, instead of writing them directly here.

raw_records = [
    " Survey_2026 , rating=4 , age=23 ",
    "SURVEY_2027 , RATING=2 , AGE=30",
    " survey_2028 , rating=5 , age=22 ",
    "SURVEY_2029 , RATING=1 , AGE=45",
    " survey_2030 , rating=4 , age=28 ",
]
   # replace with your code


# =============================================================== PROCESS + OUTPUT
# 3. Parse and report on every record.
#
#    Threshold : parse each record, print the cleaned dict.
#    Typical   : also call status_of(...) for each, print it alongside.
#    Excellent : print a one-line summary at the end - how many records,
#                how many flagged.

for raw_record in raw_records:
  try:
    data = parse_line(raw_record)
    status = status_of(data)
    print(data, "->", status)
  except ValueError:
    print(f"Could not parse: {raw_record}")

# ==========================================================================
# 4. Before you finish:
#
#    [ ] Run it against at least 5 genuinely messy raw records
#    [ ] Run it with a value that will not convert to a number - write the
#        error down
#    [ ] Check every function does one job, with a docstring
